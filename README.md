# Forecasting the S&P500 Index using ARIMA and VAR model

## Abstract
The work presented in this research is a contribution to modeling and forecasting the S&P 500, the financial health indicator for US Markets, by using both ARIMA and VAR models. Using the ARIMA model, our study predicted and estimated a slight increase of S&P 500 values over the following five day period. Using the VAR model with other US financial indexes (Russell 2000, Willshire 5000), a global market index (MSCI World), and a Korean index (KOSPI), we also obtain a slight increase in the prediction. The limitations of the use of historical data to forecast the future value of the S&P 500 due to the lack of discernible patterns are addressed in this research paper. The results can contribute to the existing estimates of future S&P 500 values.
